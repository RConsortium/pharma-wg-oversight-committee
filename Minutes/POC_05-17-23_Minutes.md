The meeting started late, partly because of some confusion about the right link to use. RC operations is attempting to eliminate obsolete meeting links. The correct link will have the organizer listed as admin@r-consortium.org.

Joseph Rickert started the meeting asking the organizing committee to make recommendations about the strategic importance of various pharma related organizations to the R Consortium. Those present identified the following:

* [ASA](https://www.amstat.org/)
  * is a non-profit or organization financed through individual level membership
  * is an RC member
  * the RC provides a GitHub repo for the Bio Pharma Software engineering working group
  * the RC occasionally promotes WG activities through social media
  
* [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/)
  * is a non-profit organization primarily concerned with data standards for the pharmaceutical industry
  * CDISC is collaborating with PhUSE
  
* [PharmaSUG](https://www.pharmasug.org/)
  * is a non-profit software users group
  * historically involved with SAS
  * probably not of immediate interest to the RC
  
* [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/)
  * It's organizational structure is not clear
  * It presently has no legal organizational structure, e.g. the pharmaverse is not a non-profit organization
  * PhUSE will apparently be providing "support" to the pharmaverse
  * Sumesh Kalappurakal, an RC Board member and pharmaverse council member will clarify the status of the pharmaverse at the next RC Board meeting
  
* [PhUSE](https://phuse.global/)
  * is a non-profit organization financed through individual level membership
  * is interested in open source activities outside of R
  * Michael Rimler is the new PhUSE Director of Open Source
  * is an R Consortium partner
  * Support should include social media promotion
  * The RC should expect reciprocation
  
* [PSI](https://psiweb.org/)
  * is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the use of statistics in the health care industry
  * is an RC partner
  
* [R/Pharma](https://psiweb.org/)

  * It is non-known whether R/Pharma a non-profit organization or an informal collaboration of individuals
  
* [Transcelerate](https://www.transceleratebiopharmainc.com/)
  * is a large, well financed non-profit organization with a mission to collaborate on global research
  * has considerable influence with the FDA
  * is not an open source champion and takes care to be language, product, company open source and proprietary software agnostic
  * is probably not of interest to the RC
  
**Action**

 1. The RC should keep a list of all events at which RC working group members are speaking and promote those events.
 2. The Oversight Committee should provide additional strategic direction about events and activities to support.
 
The next meeting of the Pharma Oversight Committee will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Wednesday, June 7.
