Minutes by Joseph B Rickert

JBR opened the meeting with four items on the agenda:
1. The R Certification Program
2. New Members for the R Consortium
3. useR! 2023
4. R Validation Hub Repository project

### The R Certification Program

Working with the Linux Foundation, the R Consortium has developed a preliminary business plan to use the work being done in the R Certification working group to pilot an R Consortium R Certification Program. The viability of the plan depends on developing accurate estimates of the available market for this initial certification certificate which would be targeted towards certifying competence in R and relevant SAS knowledge for statistical programmers seeking to work in a clinical environment.  SK presented feedback he elicited from the [Pharma Statistical Programming Heads Council](https://phuse.global/Communications/PHUSE_Blog/pharma-statistical-programming-heads-council) which he summarized as follows:

* General R Certification for SAS programmers on Pharma domain is a great idea but can’t be consider a qualifier rather complement to skills and personal development.
* Didn’t see much value in SAS certification due to generalization, so if R certification more target to R users from Pharma on skills that can applied directly to everyday coding and visualization, it will be well received.
* If certification can be complimented with training to up skill, then it would motivate users.
R certification should be unique and build a standard that is different from other online certifications.
* Would be more of nice to have rather than must have.

**Action** JBR will present this information at next week's R Consortium Board meeting

### New Members
JBR asked if, based on existing relationships with colleagues outside of their respective companies, group members could identify Pharma companies who might be good candidates to join the R Consortium.

### useR! 2023

* JBR described the agreement that the R Consortium and Linux Foundation reached with the R Foundation to provide logistics support for useR! 2023 and noted that any revenue made from a successful conference would be split between the R Foundation and the hosting university, while the R Consortium will cover Linux Foundation fees should the conference loose money.
* JB confirmed that Roche and LMU to host a hybrid useR! 2023 conference in Basel.

### R Validation Hub
The group discussed the R Validation Hub's project to stand up a CRAN-like repository that would be suitable for Pharma submissions to the FDA. Look [here](https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg) for further details about the project.
