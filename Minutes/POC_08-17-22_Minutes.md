Minutes by Joseph B Rickert

JBR brought the meeting to order.
SK reported a problem with calendar invitations for R Consortium meetings. Apparently, not everyone who should have received updates for the September 28th Board Meeting, the R Certification Working Group meeting and other R Consortium meetings. SK also reported that the notice for nominations to run for the Silver Member board seat vacated by Google went to Paulo Bargo and not to him as it should have.

**Action Item**: JBR and ET will check the status of the calendar invitations to meetings and will update the R Consortium's list of member contacts. JBR will also send out reminders before Pharma Oversight Committee Meetings (POC).

There were three main discussion topics

### R Consortium Membership 
JBR suggested that POC members could help recruit new members to the R Consortium by proactively reaching out to members from other pharmas with whom they regularly cooperate outside of the R Consortium. This led to a robust discussion about:

* The need to better articulate the benefits of joining the R Consortium to senior level pharma management who often perceive that their companies can reap the benefits of R Consortium work without joining the RC.
* The continuing need to make the case for RC membership to executives of their own organizations whenever there is a leadership change or reorganization
* The continuing need to promote the benefits of open source software to company executives who believe that SAS could carry them through the foreseeable future.

JBR emphasized that real benefits of joining the R Consortium include:

* The ability to influence RC spending and policy
* The influence within the R Community of having a company being perceived as taking a leadership role in the community.
* The access to the R Foundation and ability help build trust among the R Consortium, the R Foundation and the pharmaceutical industry
* The strategic benefit of shaping R programs, such as R Certification that would help protect and also leverage investments in R.

**Action Item**: Those present agreed that putting together a "Road Show" would be an effective means of communicating the benefits of the R Consortium to pharma executives.


### Gaining Influence with the FDA

It was generally agreed that demonstrating influence with the FDA is something valued by pharma executives. The R Submissions projects, the recent R Consortium  webinar featuring a panel discussion with FDA members which drew over 600 virtual attendees, and other activities that draw FDA participation are highly valued.

The group discussed the effort to use containers in future FDA pilot submissions, and agreed that providing leadership in recommending and facilitating the use of container technology might help to influence the way the FDA upgrades its submission gateway infrastructure and procedures.

**Action Item**: POC should initiate an effort to investigate containers.

### R Certification

There was a brief discussion about the benefits and next steps of the R Consortium's efforts to develop an R Consortium certification program. Several POC members are participating in the R Certification working group meetings. The next meeting of the R Certification WG will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Wednesday, 2022-08-31. Please contact JBR if you have not received a calender invitation.

The next meeting of the POC will be at 9AM Pacific Time on Wednesday, 2022-09-07.
