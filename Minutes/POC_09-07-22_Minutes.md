Minutes by Joseph B Rickert


The group began with a discussion on how to move forward with the concept of a "Road Show" introduced last meeting to pitch the value of the R Consortium both to potential new RC members and to the management of existing RC members who may not be familiar with the RC. In this context, JBR mentioned a comment made by new RC Board Member Mike Smith of Pfizer that much of the infrastructure work that the RC does should also be of value to companies that are mixed R and Python shops.

**Action Item**: The group will begin collecting material helpful for showing the value of the RC in the documents folder of the GitHub repo: https://github.com/RConsortium/pharma-wg-oversight-committee

JBR mentioned that he would like the RC's ISC committee to take the lead on recommending areas of R that would benefit from ISC grants, and suggested that the RC pharma member companies might benefit from suggesting areas of new statistical development for the R Community to consider. This led to a discussion of innovative statistical development work that is being done by various pharma industry related groups and the possibility of having the RC aligning with some of them.
