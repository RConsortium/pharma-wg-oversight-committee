Minutes by Joseph B Rickert

JBR informed the group that the R Consortium Board of Directors is evaluating the possibility of the R Consortium developing R certification programs as a source of revenue, and that he is working with Linux Foundation to develop a business plan. The initial idea is to build on the work being done in the R Certification working group to develop a certification program for the skills to for a statistical programmer to be effective in a clinical trials team using both SAS and R. 

As a first step to estimate the target market the group suggested the following estimates for the number of programmers who might take a certification examination for three ranges of company size:

Company size | number of programmers
| :--- | :--- |
Large | 200 to 400 
Medium | 50 to 200
Small | less than 50

**Action Item** both SH and SK will ask their company representatives who participate in the [Pharma Statistical Programming Heads Council](https://phuse.global/Communications/PHUSE_Blog/pharma-statistical-programming-heads-council) to see if the council is able to provide more accurate estimates.

JBR asked SK if he could provide an overview of the [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) project. SK provided a brief summary, noting that the pharmaverse is a group of individuals who are curating a list of R packages that cover the submissions process from clinical reporting workflow from CRF to eSubmission. There was a question about how the GitHub repositories are organized under the R-universe project. Note that the package repos may be reached via https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev/ui#packages or through https://github.com/pharmaverse/. SK said that he would confer with the pharmaverse council and provide more information about the project at a later time.

The next meeting will be held at 9AM Pacific Time on Wednesday November 30, 2022.
