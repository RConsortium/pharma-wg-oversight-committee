JBR began the meeting by providing an update on some of the topics discussed in the recent R Consortium Board meeting.

### Partners
The Board discussed the relationship of the R Consortium with its partners Phuse, the ASA, etc. and agreed that the RC marketing team should continue to provide social media and promotional support as resources permit. The Board was appreciative of the account Sumesh gave on the pharmaverse and its and its work to promote R packages for clinical reporting.

### Gold Level Membership

The Board is discussing the idea of reviving the Gold membership in order to introduce a membership level that could be tiered with respect to company size. There is some evidence that smaller companies who are not be able to finance the annual $100K dues level associated with platinum membership would like to an option above silver to participate in the R Consortium. It is not clear, however, that we would be able to articulate a value proposition and derive breakpoints and the associated dues amounts to make this concept viable.

### Upcoming Silver Member Board Elections

The silver level members present confirmed that their companies will have their nominations in by June 9. JBR mentioned that in order to enhance the stability of the Board preserve some continuity in membership, the Board is considering extending the term or service for silver level members to two years, and staggering the elections so that no more than half of the silver members are up for election in a given year. The members present expressed enthusiasm for this scheme.

### R Foundation events

Planning is under way for the two R Foundation Conference Committee (RFCC) sanction events planned for the summer of 2023.
