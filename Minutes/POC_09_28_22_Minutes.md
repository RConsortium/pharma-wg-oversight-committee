Minutes by Joseph B Rickert

JBR began the meeting by noting that he is now a member of the [ASA BIOP Software Engineering Working Group](https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/new-page2) that is being headed-up by Daniel Sabanes Bove. The group has developed the [mmrm package](https://github.com/openpharma/mmrm) and is working to improve the software engineering of R packages. The group also has an R Consortium hosted GitHub repo: https://github.com/RConsortium/asa-biop-swe-wg.

This lead to a discussion about the numerous pharma related organizations such as PHUSE, the pharmaverse, R/Pharma that have overlapping interests and members. All agreed that it would be helpful to develop an understanding of how they all fit together.

Keaven shared an [article by Nan Xiao](https://nanx.me/blog/post/ectd-pkglite-paper/) announcing the publication of [Electronic Common Technical Document Submission with Analysis Using R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17407745221123244) which describes the [pkglite](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkglite) package used in the R Consortium's FDA Pilot submission.

JBR then stated that the R Consortium Board of Directors was considering investing in an effort to develop an R certification program, and noted that if the Board decided to pursue this, it would likely try to leverage the efforts of the R Certification working group which is developing a certification examination for statistical programmers working in a mixed SAS and R environment. JBR asked the group if he thought that pharma companies would be interested in financing this effort. He asked the group to think about this, and stated that he would keep the group informed about any new developments.
